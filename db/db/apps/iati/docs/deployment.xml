    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://exist-db.org">Exist documentation</a>
        </li>
        <li>A spreadsheet describing the<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ap_pOl9XgkPodFVuYVZnX0w0TlBxY215OS1zMF8xdXc#gid=0">  directories and files</a> in the eXist 2.0 distribution - (by Chris Wallace - use with caution)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
    <div> The current version is running on eXist <s>version 2.0-tech-preview</s> build from trunk
        so that the scheduler module can be included. Unable to generate an installer so the current
        version is the full buult system. The notes below assume the availability of a installable
        jar. <ol>
            <li>wget to fetch resources</li>
            <li>Java 6 - <s>using opensdk</s> using OracleJDK 1.6</li>
            <li>Apache webserver implements the virtual hosts. </li>
            <li>sftp to move files between client and server</li>
            <li>zip</li>
            <li>you also need the same version of eXist (2.0) running locally since the java client
                is used to set permissions and passwords, and install applications </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>Deployment</h2>
    <div>This installs the application into /db/apps/iati, system tools into /db/apps/sys , common
        library modules into /db/lib and index configuration files into
        /db/system/config/db/apps/iati. </div>
    <ol>
        <li>[server] download the jar file from the <a href="http://exist-db.org">eXist site</a>
        </li>
        <li>[server] install exist : run java -jar {jarfile} -p {absoluteinstallpath} - make sure to
            use the full path here because it becomes EXIST_HOME - I've been using
            /usr/local/exist</li>
        <li>[client] unpack the application zip </li>
        <li>[ erver]the distributed configuration file needs some changes - in
            particular to allow inclusion of some modules which are excluded by default. There is a
            copy of the current conf.xml file in the distribution in
            (/db/apps/iati/system/conf.xml).  Replace EXIST_HOME/conf.xml with this file </li>
        <li>[server] to define the virtual host there is a apache file
            ((/db/apps/iati/system/datdev.aidinfolabs.org.conf). In CENTOS this file would be
            located in /etc/httpd/conf.d</li>
        <li>[server] to increase the memory available to the application, edit the file {$EXIST_HOME}/bin/function.d/eXist-settings.sh</li>
        <li>[server] cd to the install directory </li>
        <li>[server] start the httpd service if not already </li>
        <li>[server] start the database : bin/startup.sh</li>
        <li>[client] use the java client to access the running database, logging in as admin with a
            blank password - change the admin password.</li>
        <li>[client] also add the db user see config.xqm.</li>
        <li>[server] run the post-install script (in /db/apps/iati/xquery) -
             this creates the data and olap collections  and index files for  each corpus defined in corpusindex, sets some public
            permissions and reindexes</li>
        <li>[server] check that the data directories and permissions - permissions can be set using the java client</li>
        <li>[client] review the constants in config.xqm - for admin purposes there is the IP address
            there.  If you have installed to any other directory than /db/apps/iati, you will need to
            update this module to change $config:base to the new collection.</li>
        <li>The application is now deployed.</li>
    </ol>
