    <h1>Pipelines</h1>
    <div>On loading, each activity is passed through a number of transformations which augment the
        activity document with computed data in the iati-ad namespace. Augemented data include
        transaction values and totals normalised to USD 2010 values, added keys, proportioned values
        over multiple countries, regions etc.</div>
    <div>It was envisaged that this would be configurable as a pipeline of steps and the pipeline.xqm
        module implements this pipeline, using the supplied pipeline configuration file to determine the
        sequence and action of each step. As of May 2012, this pipeline is actually hard coded in
        the pipeline1.xqm module for efficiency reasons/</div>
    <div>Which (if any) pipeline is used is defined in the corpus index entry</div>
