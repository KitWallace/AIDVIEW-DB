    <h1>Sample Paths</h1>
    <div> Search of the activities in a crpus is provided by arbitrary XPath expressions. XPath is a
        powerful expression language. In the corpus search, the path expression is inserted into an
        expression equivalent to /activity[path] so that selected activities are those which satisfy
        the condition expressed by the path. This page provides some examples of typical XPath
        expressions to achieve specific selection aims. Links are to executions of the selection on the unit test corpus. Executions on the full corpus can take longer to execute since the database indexing is not optimised for these queries.
