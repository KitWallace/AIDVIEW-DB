    <h1>Activities</h1>
    <h2>Uploading</h2>
    <div>The list of activitySets is obtained from the CKAN repository and results in an updated
        activitySets.xml document in the data/{corpus} directory. This master file is used in
        downloading each activitySet document from its host site. Each activity in the downloaded
        activitySet is processed through a pipeline of transformations and then written as a
        document in the data{corpus}/activities directory with a UUID key </div>
    <div>activitySets can also be uploaded directly from a URL</div>
    <h2>Browsing, searching and querying</h2>
    <div>The application provides a basic browser for loaded activities. The OLAP provides a faceted
        view of the activities as well as views by host or all activities. Activities can be
        searched using Lucene by free text in the title or the description.</div>
