    <h1>Corpus</h1>
    <div>Data on activities is divided into 'corpus' sections. Each corpus contains the master list of activitySets, 
        the collection of activities and the <a href="/data/doc/OLAP">OLAP</a>. The rationale for this level is:
        <ul>
            <li>To support developement, so that test data sets can be treated like any other set </li>
            <li>To support public access to a corpus for ad-hoc validation</li>
            <li>To support staging of activities</li>
            <li>To support multiple transformations of the data for example to distinguish between corpuses using different year bases for conversion, or different approaches to project value computation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>Initially there will be four corpuses - 3 public and one private. The private corpus vstore is used for casual loading and validation. Files and collections are publicly writeable to support the ad-hoc validation</div>
    <div>The corpus descriptor contains the reference for the pipeline for that corpus.  Currently vstore has no pipeline defined whilst the others use the only defined pipeline.</div>
